Javascript assessment

What did you like about this project?

It was very very challenging and forced me to think way out of the box. It also allowed me to create my first game from Javascript, albeit with kickstarted code provided.


What did you struggle with in this project?

Certain concepts and putting all the pieces together from scratch. The concepts tested in this project were quite a step up from the examples done in class.


What would make your experience with this assessment better?

I think if there were practice examples in the lessons more closely resembling that would help a lot.
